 * Which web pages may call this service from a browser (CORS).

 * **Voice (`/api/livekit/…`) is open to any page.** A Space's voice server is called by everyone in
 * the Space, and someone in it from another Matrix server uses their own server's app (another
 * Purrlor at another address, or Element): limited to this deployment's own app, the browser refused
 * them, and they saw "Failed to fetch". Nothing is lost by opening it. These routes don't use
 * cookies or any credential a browser adds by itself; each request carries a Matrix OpenID token
 * proving who's asking, and a token is only given for a voice channel in a Space this server serves
 * to a member of it (server.ts, membership.ts, tenancy.ts), whichever page asked.
 *
 * Everything else keeps to `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (comma-separated; `*` for any; `https://*.example.com`
 * for its subdomains).
