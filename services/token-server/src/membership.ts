/**
 * A persistent Matrix service-account bot, logged in once at process start, that stays joined
 * to whatever rooms/spaces it serves so it can read membership/power level *locally*
 * instead of doing federation state resolution itself — this mirrors element-hq/lk-jwt-service's
 * approach.
 *
 * Which rooms it will go into is not its own decision: every join here runs through
 * `tenancy.ts`, which admits only local rooms that a Space this deployment serves claims as a
 * child. Anyone at all can send an invite, so an unconditional auto-join made the bot — and the
 * LiveKit deployment behind it — reachable by any user anywhere on the federation.
 *
 * Deliberately skips E2EE setup entirely (no initRustCrypto, no crypto store): the bot only
 * ever reads room state (m.room.member, m.room.power_levels), which Matrix never encrypts —
 * only timeline *messages* in encrypted rooms are, and this bot never reads those. That keeps
 * this service free of the WASM-crypto packaging concerns the browser client has to deal with.
