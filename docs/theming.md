# Theming Purrlor

Purrlor supports fully custom CSS themes — not a fixed set of preset toggles. This document is
the contract theme authors (and future us) rely on. Treat renaming anything listed here as a
breaking change.

**Working on a theme?** Open the app with `?demo` (see the README's "Demo mode"). It renders the
whole UI — populated channel list, timeline with Markdown and reactions, member list, modals,
settings, voice join/error states — against fabricated data with no homeserver, so you can
iterate on a stylesheet without needing a live account or a Space full of real messages to look
at. The one thing it can't show you is the inside of a connected call.

## Two layers

1. **Token layer** (`apps/web/src/styles/tokens.css`) — CSS custom properties on `:root` for
   color, spacing, radius, and typography. Overriding a handful of variables reskins most of
   the app. This is the easy 90% case.
2. **Structural selectors** — every structurally meaningful element carries a stable `nu-`
   prefixed BEM class and/or a `data-nu-role="..."` attribute. These never come from CSS
   Modules or CSS-in-JS (no hashed class names), specifically so a theme's raw CSS can target
   them reliably across rebuilds. A full custom stylesheet, loaded at runtime after the base
   styles, can override anything reachable through these selectors — see "Loading a theme"
   below.

## Naming convention

- Prefix: `nu-` (namespaces against LiveKit's own default component CSS and any third-party
  CSS pulled in later). It comes from the project's old name, NekoUs, and stays as-is: it's the
  contract every saved custom theme targets.
- BEM: `nu-block`, `nu-block__element`, `nu-block--modifier`.
- `data-nu-role="..."` is added alongside classes for elements a theme is likely to select
  independent of current visual state (e.g. `data-nu-role="voice-tile"` regardless of
  mute/speaking modifier classes).
- Rule of thumb for what gets a hook: would a theme author plausibly want to select this?
  Pure implementation-detail styling (a one-off layout hack inside a settings modal nobody
  would reskin) can use scoped/local styles instead — the rule is "structural/component-identity
  classes must be stable strings," not "no build tooling ever."

## Current token reference

| Token | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--nu-color-bg-app` | Outermost app background (server rail) |
| `--nu-color-bg-primary` | Channel list / member list background |
| `--nu-color-bg-secondary` | Main content pane background |
| `--nu-color-bg-tertiary` | Inputs, recessed surfaces |
| `--nu-color-bg-elevated` | Popovers, menus |
| `--nu-color-text-primary` / `-secondary` / `-muted` | Text hierarchy |
| `--nu-color-text-link` | Links |
| `--nu-color-accent` / `-accent-hover` | Primary action color (gradient's first stop) |
| `--nu-color-accent-2` / `-accent-2-hover` | Gradient's second stop — buttons, active rows, and gradient text are two-tone, not flat, so this is the other half of that gradient |
| `--nu-color-on-accent` | Text/icons drawn on top of accent/danger/success/warning — a button's label, a badge's count. One token so a theme that picks a light/pastel accent only has to repoint this once, not hunt down every button that happens to sit on that color |
| `--nu-color-scheme` | `dark` or `light`: which way the browser's own controls lean (checkboxes, `<select>` menus, date pickers, scrollbars). Every preset is `dark`; a light custom theme sets `light`. Native checkboxes and sliders also take `--nu-color-accent` |
| `--nu-color-danger` / `-danger-2` / `-success` / `-warning` | Status colors (`-danger-2` is danger's gradient second stop, same idea as `-accent-2`) |
| `--nu-color-role-admin` / `-role-moderator` | Name color (timeline and member list) and group swatch for members with that role — see `matrix/roles.ts` for the power-level tiers |
| `--nu-color-border` | Hairline borders/dividers |
| `--nu-color-backdrop` | Dimming behind a modal / the recovery-key prompt |
| `--nu-color-backdrop-strong` | Darker dimming behind the image lightbox specifically |
| `--nu-gradient-accent` / `-accent-hover` / `-accent-diagonal` / `-accent-text` / `-danger` | Gradients built from the color tokens above — repoint the two flat colors rather than these directly unless you want a genuinely different gradient shape |
| `--nu-space-half` | 2px — tight list-row gaps (below the smallest step of the space scale) |
| `--nu-space-1` … `--nu-space-6` | Spacing scale (4px–24px) |
| `--nu-radius-sm` / `-md` / `-lg` / `-full` | Corner radii (6/8/14px, plus pill) |
| `--nu-radius-tile` | The server rail's square space icons, and anything drawn to match them (the space card icon, a channel's welcome icon) |
| `--nu-font-body` | Base font stack — body copy, message text |
| `--nu-font-display` | Only where a name is the headline: the space name, channel titles, a channel's welcome header (Dela Gothic One by default) |
| `--nu-font-mono` | Code |
| `--nu-font-size-xs` / `-sm` / `-md` / `-lg` / `-xl` | Font sizes (11.5/13.5/15/17/24px) |
| `--nu-font-size-message` | Message text, the sender's name above it, and the composer (16px) |
| `--nu-width-server-rail` / `-channel-list` / `-member-list` | Shell column widths |
| `--nu-height-header` | Shared height of the three column headers, so their bottom borders line up |

The default theme also names eight reusable animation keyframes in `tokens.css` — `nu-spin`,
`nu-pulse-glow`, `nu-bounce-dot`, `nu-pop-in`, `nu-twinkle`, `nu-rise-in` (a card arriving),
`nu-fade-in` (a menu or backdrop), `nu-dialog-in` (a modal's panel) — a custom theme's own CSS can
reference any of them by name (`animation: nu-pop-in .4s ...`) instead of redefining them. `nu-ears-up` is the
selected server tile's cat-ear entrance.

Every icon is an inline SVG (`components/Icon.tsx`) drawn in `currentColor` and tagged
`data-nu-icon="<name>"`, so recoloring a button recolors its icon, and a theme can target one
icon (`[data-nu-icon="paw"]`) without a class of its own.

Two floating icon buttons — the image lightbox's close button and the voice panel's
screen-share pop-out button — deliberately do **not** use these tokens for their own
background/text color: they sit on top of an arbitrary photo or screen share, not app chrome,
so a translucent-white control that reads on any image is the right call regardless of theme.
See the comments on `.nu-lightbox__close` and `.nu-voice-panel__screen-share-popout`.

This table grows as new components ship — update it in the same change that adds a token.

## Loading a theme

Implemented: Account Settings → Appearance (`src/app/AppearanceSettings.tsx`) is a raw-CSS
editor — paste or load-from-file a stylesheet, hit Apply, and it's injected as a single
`<style id="nu-theme-override">` appended after the base stylesheet (`src/app/theme.ts`).
Cascade order does the overriding, no `!important` needed — a theme's own `:root { --nu-color-
accent: ...; }` beats the base token definition simply by loading later, and anything targeting
a `nu-` class or `data-nu-role` at equal-or-higher specificity than the base rule wins the same
way. The CSS is stored in `localStorage` (single browser, single user — not synced to the
Matrix account, not shared with anyone) and re-applied on every load via `applyStoredThemeOnLoad()`, called from `main.tsx` before React renders anything.

Mostly **not** a picker over a set of built-in presets: this is a single-user, self-hosted app,
so "write your own overrides" covers the real use case without this project shipping and
maintaining a big look-and-feel library. The panel embeds a condensed copy of the token table
above so a theme author doesn't have to come find this file to know what's overridable.

The one exception is `THEME_PRESETS` in `AppearanceSettings.tsx` — a couple of explicitly
requested, ready-made starting points ("Y2K Chatroom", the old default; "Lola", a
black-and-hot-pink palette; "Halloween") rendered as swatch chips above the editor. Clicking one
loads its CSS into the textarea (it still isn't applied until Apply, same as "Load from file")
rather than a hidden or hard-to-edit choice. Most presets only override *color* tokens — the
gradient/radius/font/animation tokens are derived from those in `tokens.css`, so a preset
reskins the whole app without redefining shape or motion.

"Halloween" (`src/app/themes/halloween.ts`) is the worked example of going further while staying
an ordinary theme: pumpkin and cat-eye colors and Creepster for display text, then rules on `nu-`
classes and `data-nu-role`s that dress the mascot up. The selected Space's cat ears turn black, a
black cat sits on the user panel swishing its tail, and eyes blink in the dark at the bottom of the
rail. The empty screen gets a cat under a harvest moon, channel welcomes a cat-faced
jack-o'-lantern, and the main pane a cobweb with a spider on its thread, fog, and bats now and then.
Every picture is an SVG in a `data:` URI (written out readably in the module, encoded when the
preset is built), so the CSS stands alone wherever it's pasted and stays inside the CSP. The
CSS-driven motion sits in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`. Its test checks that
the sanitizer keeps every rule and that each SVG parses, and `e2e/security.spec.ts` applies it
under production's CSP.

The shipped default ("Y2K Chatroom") keeps Discord's layout — server rail, channel list, main
timeline, member list — but leans into a glossy, candy-gradient, early-2000s-internet look
(originally planned as a Claude Design canvas before being carried over into the real token/CSS
layer) rather than a flat/muted clone. It's still just *a* theme sitting on the same mechanism
described above: anyone who wants something else entirely — including a flatter, more
Discord-literal look — reskins it the same way any other custom theme would, by overriding the
tokens and selectors in this document, not by patching the shipped CSS.

**Themes from other people.** "Load from file" means a theme can come from anyone, and CSS can leak
what's on the page without running code: a rule like `input[value^="a"] { background: url(…) }`
fetches a different address for each letter typed. Two things stop that:

- The Content-Security-Policy (`apps/web/deploy/security-headers.conf`, docs/deployment.md,
  "Security headers") lets `@import` and fonts load only from the app and Google Fonts. Background
  images may come from any `https` address, since themes use them.
- `app/themeSanitize.ts` leaves out every rule whose selector matches on an attribute's value,
  unless the attribute is one of the app's own presentational ones: `data-nu-role`, `data-nu-icon`
  and the other `data-nu-*` (except `data-nu-event-id` and `data-nu-link`), `class`, `id`, `type`,
  ARIA states. Presence checks (`[title]`) are fine. Appearance settings lists any rule it left out.
  The theme is saved as written, so editing it later shows what you wrote.

A theme that targets the documented tokens and `[data-nu-role="…"]` selectors is never changed.
