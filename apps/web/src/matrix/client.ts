// (switching accounts, or a previous login/registration attempt that got this far before failing
// or being abandoned without a clean logout — see logoutClient's own comment on clearStores()
// being able to hang and leave stale data behind): the Rust crypto engine hard-fails
// initRustCrypto() if its store already holds an Olm/Megolm account bound to a *different*

// migration). The real Rust crypto engine manages its own separate IndexedDB databases, named
// `{prefix}::matrix-sdk-crypto` and `{prefix}::matrix-sdk-crypto-meta` with prefix defaulting to
// "matrix-js-sdk" (this app never overrides it) — confirmed directly from matrix-js-sdk's own
// `MatrixClient.clearStores()` implementation, which deletes exactly these four names together.
// Not importing that default from matrix-js-sdk/lib/rust-crypto/constants.js: that's a deep
// internal module path, not something its package exports guarantee stable across versions —
// hardcoding the literal name here (like livekitRoomName's cross-service duplication elsewhere
// in this repo) is more robust than depending on an internal import resolving at all. First
// attempt at this fix only wiped the two legacy names above and left the real Rust store

// rejected — only the final mismatch check failed), and nothing here exposes a way to close any
// of those connections. `indexedDB.deleteDatabase()` on a database with any open connection
// doesn't fail — it fires `onblocked` and stays pending until every connection closes, which
// never happens on its own within this same page (confirmed live, twice: retrying in-place after
// a "wipe" silently no-ops and hits the identical mismatch again, every time). Closing those
// connections deterministically means tearing down this page's whole JS realm —
// `location.reload()` (not just a fresh navigation, which Chrome's back/forward cache can
// sometimes serve without actually dropping old connections) reliably does that. So: mark that a
