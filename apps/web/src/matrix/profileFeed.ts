 * A person's **profile feed** — where a post goes when its author picks "Global" instead of one
 * of their Spaces. It's a feed room like any Space member's (feed.ts), with three differences:
 *
 * - It belongs to no Space, so it can't be restricted to one: history is `world_readable` and
 *   the room is **listed in the directory** under its own room type, which is how the global feed
 *   finds every profile on the server (globalFeed.ts) without anyone having to be in anything.
 * - Its room type (`xyz.nekous.profile`) keeps it out of places a listed room would otherwise
 *   appear: Discover filters it out, and its `feed` channel type keeps it out of Direct Messages
 *   once someone joins it.
 * - Its ID is also published on the owner's extended profile, so a profile page can find it from
 *   a user ID alone.
 *
 * One per person, created on their first global post.
