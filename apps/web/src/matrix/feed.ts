/**
 * Posts — a per-member timeline inside a Space, so a hub is somewhere you publish under your own
 * name and not only somewhere you chat. The Pleroma-shaped feature without a Pleroma: no second
 * server, no second account, no ActivityPub inbox, and no separate moderation queue.
 *
 * **The constraint that shapes all of this:** Matrix has no per-event visibility. History
 * visibility is a property of the *room*. A "private" flag on an event sitting in a readable
 * room would be decoration — the event is still right there in `/messages` for anyone who can
 * read the room. So privacy here is decided by *where a post lives*, never by a field on it:
 *
 * - **Public** — an `xyz.nekous.post` event in the author's feed room, which is `world_readable`.
 * - **Private** — the author's own account data, exactly where `savedMessages.ts` keeps
 *   bookmarks. No other user can read it, because it was never in a room to begin with.
 *
 * Making a public post private redacts the event and writes its text back to account data;
 * publishing a private one does the reverse. The post gets a new event ID either way, so
 * reactions don't survive the move — which is the honest outcome, since its audience changed.
 */

 * A post. Deliberately its own event type rather than an `m.room.message`, for two reasons: it
 * can be power-level gated on its own (`events: { 'xyz.nekous.post': 100 }` in a feed room, so
 * only the owner posts while everyone keeps the default level for reactions), and a feed room
 * peeked from Element shows nothing rather than a chat log that isn't one. The *content* is
 * message-shaped (`body` / `format` / `formatted_body`), so `renderMessageText` and
 * `buildMessageFormatting` work on it completely unchanged.

 * tenancy gate closes — a member who can add Space children can add their own room and claim
