/**
 * The other half of inviteLinks.ts's buildInviteLink: on mount, checks for `?invite=<roomId>` in
 * the URL (the same query-param convention useOpenRoomFromNotification.ts uses for `?openRoom=`)
 * and, if present, actually JOINS that room — unlike openRoom, which assumes membership already
 * exists, an invite link visitor usually isn't a member yet. Strips the param from the URL
 * immediately, before the join even resolves, so a page refresh can't trigger a duplicate attempt
 * — this also means the param survives LoginScreen's onLoggedIn full-page reload for an
 * unauthenticated visitor (the URL is untouched until this effect itself runs, which only happens
 * once the app has a live MatrixClient to join with, i.e. after login/registration completes).
 *
 * Tries a plain join first, THEN retries with the link's `?via=` hint only if that fails — not the
 * other way around. Confirmed live against a real (disposable) Continuwuity homeserver that these
 * two cases both really happen and pull in opposite directions:
 * - A join with no via hint at all can fail outright — M_UNKNOWN "no servers that are in the room
 *   have been provided" — when the joining user's own homeserver has no resident member left in
 *   the room (e.g. the room's only-ever member on that homeserver already left it). `via` fixes
 *   this by pointing at a server that's actually still in the room.
 * - But unconditionally sending a `via` for a room the joining user's OWN homeserver already knows
 *   about in full (the common case — same homeserver as an existing member) can make Continuwuity
 *   specifically route the request through its federated-join code path instead of joining
 *   locally, attempting real outbound federation traffic for what was actually a fully local
 *   join, which fails in this project's own test environment (bare `http://`/`localhost`, no
 *   working self-federation) — and is a plausible cost even in production (a real federation round
 *   trip where none was needed). Plain-first avoids that cost whenever it isn't actually necessary.
